The approach to token trading by the MuesliSwap Team distinguishes itself from the popular approaches to trading, taking into account the Cardano transaction model. 

The EUTxO model of the Cardano blockchain makes it possible to use the order book model as a decentralized exchange, in contrast to the AMM model used on other blockchains. MuesliSwap support limit orders bringing full control to your investments. What's more, the innovative protocol offers liquidity pools that provide liquidity to the orderbook while letting users earn pasive income through trading fees and yield farming.
